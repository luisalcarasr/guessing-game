# Guessing Game

I have implemented a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here's how it has worked: I have generated a random integer between 1 and 100. I have then prompted the player to enter a guess. After a guess has been entered, I have indicated whether the guess has been too low or too high. If the guess has been correct, the game has printed a congratulatory message and exited.

## Quick Start

To run the game, execute the following command in the terminal:

```sh
cargo run
```

## Credits

Example taken from the official Rust book, contains some modifications.
